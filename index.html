                    <h4>The Early Years</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">I was born and raised north of Salt Lake in Bountiful, UT. Growing up, I loved to learn, ski, play sports and play videogames with my friends. I was a student at Bountiful High School where I participated in student council. Following high school I attended BYU's Marriott School of Business and majored in Finance.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Shortly after graduating from college, I adopted a puppy who has become my best pal. He's half Bernese Mountain Dog, half Poodle, all bark and no bite.</p>
                    <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
                        <h6><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Comcast NBC Universal</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">Out of college, I as recruited to participate in a corporate finance rotational program through three divisions of Comcast NBC Universal, one of the world's largest telecom and media companies. This provided me with a great breadth of experience within corporate finance</p>
                            <p class="card-text">My three rotations took me through the following roles:</p>
                                <ul class="pl-5">
                                    <li>Comcast West Division Revenue Analyst -- Denver, CO</li>
                                    <li>NBC Universal First Run Syndication Financial Analysis -- New York, NY</li>
                                    <li>Comcast Corporate Headquarters Xfinity Home Product Analysis -- Philadelphia, PA</li>
                                </ul>
                        <h6><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd"></i></i> sPower</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">After my time with Comcast, I took a job in Salt Lake with a solar development company as a treasury analyst. There I was primarily responsible for cash management. We managed to a relatively low cash balance of about $20MM</p>
                    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                        <h6><i class="fas fa-broadcast-tower"></i> Amateur Radio</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">When I'm not coding, you can find me making contacts on HAM radio. I primarily operate on the 20 meter band during the day and the 40 meter band at night to take advantage of ionospheric propogation. Single Side Band phone (SSB) is my mode of choice, although I have recently started to experiment with FT8, a powerful digital mode.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I have made contacts in all 50 states and 12 countries as far away as Austrailia with zero use of internet or other infrastructure. I am a member of the Amateur Radio Relay League and the Utah VHF Society.</p>
                        <h6><i class="fas fa-skiing"></i> Alpine Skiing</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">My dad taught me how to ski when I was 3 years old. I fell in love with the sport and have continued skiing ever since. Gliding effortlessly across the snow is freedom.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">My favorite terrain is steep and deep powder. When deep powder isn't in the cards, I prefer big mountain skiing and a fair amount of moguls.</p>
